# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Overview
I've modified your portfolio to work perfectly with GitHub Pages. Here's what changed and how to deploy:

## What I Changed

### 1. Static Contact Form
- **Replaced**: Server-based contact form with static version
- **New behavior**: Opens email client with pre-filled message
- **Benefits**: Works without backend, still professional

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Created**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Triggers**: Every push to main branch

### 3. Static Build Configuration
- **Created**: `vite.config.github.ts` for GitHub Pages
- **Base path**: Set to `/portfolio/` for GitHub Pages routing
- **Build output**: Optimized for static hosting

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Push all files** to your GitHub repo: `https://github.com/AgMohini/portfolio`
2. **GitHub Actions** will automatically build and deploy
3. **Visit**: `https://agmohini.github.io/portfolio/`
4. **Professional URL** ready for job applications

### Option B: Manual Build
1. **Build locally**: `npm run build`
2. **Upload**: `dist/public` folder to GitHub Pages
3. **Enable Pages**: In repo settings → Pages → Deploy from branch

## Expected Result
- **URL**: `https://agmohini.github.io/portfolio/`
- **Features**: All sections work perfectly
- **Contact**: Opens email client for direct contact
- **Mobile**: Fully responsive design
- **Fast**: Static site loads instantly

## Key Benefits
- **Professional URL**: Much better than random Vercel names
- **No server costs**: GitHub Pages is completely free
- **Automatic updates**: Push code changes for instant deployment
- **Reliable**: GitHub's robust infrastructure
- **Clean**: No complex backend dependencies

## File Structure for GitHub

## What Works on GitHub Pages
